# InsightDataScience

Just a small script that I used to get information about Insight Data Science alumni.
The main goal was to check how many alumnis with social science background the programm had.
I used Selenium since the information I wandted to get was in popovers - elements that apper only when the pointer is on a given page element.

But it looks like on March 2017 the site got easy to crawl and Selenium is not required anymore - no need to use such a powerfull tool as a web driver, 
since one can just download and parse the html file.
